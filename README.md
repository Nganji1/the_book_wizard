 THIS IS HOW THE WEB APP IS USED

  How to Use
 On the homepage, you'll see a search box at the top.
 Type in a book title, author, or keyword and click the "Search" button.
 The app will display a list of books matching your search.

 Viewing Book Details
 Each result shows the book cover, title, author, published date, and a short description.
 Click the "View Book" link to open the book's page on Google Books for more information.

 Adding to Favorites
 If you find a book you like, click the "Add to Favorites" button below its details.
 A pop-up will confirm the book is saved.
 Your favorite books appear in a separate list below the search results, not directly under the search bar.

 Managing Favorites
 In the "Favorite Books" section, you can see all books you've saved.
 To remove a book, click the "Remove from Favorites" button.
 Favorites are saved in your browser, so they stay even if you refresh or close the page.

 Error Handling
 If you search for a book and nothing is found, you'll see a "No results found" message.
 If there's a problem fetching data, an error message will appear.

 Footer & Credits
 At the bottom, you'll see a footer with credits, the year and me who designed the app.
